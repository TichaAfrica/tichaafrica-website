    <h1>Our Vision: Teachers Leading the AI Revolution</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">
      TichaAfrica is a teacher-led movement ensuring that AI in African education is designed <strong>by us, for us</strong>—not imported from foreign systems that don't understand our reality.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
    
    <p>
      Right now, AI tools are flooding African classrooms. They come from Silicon Valley, built by engineers who have never taught in a class of 60 students with no electricity. They don't account for our multilingual learners, our resource constraints, or our unique strengths.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>We're being left out of the conversation about our own future.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But here's the truth: <strong>African teachers are the experts.</strong> We know what works in our classrooms. We know our students' needs. We know our communities.
    </p>

    <h2>What We're Building</h2>
    
    <p>
      TichaAfrica is creating a platform where <strong>10,000 Founding Teachers</strong> across Africa will:
    </p>
    
    <h3>1. Share Real Classroom Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      Your daily struggles—large class sizes, multilingual students, limited resources—become the foundation for solutions that actually work.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2. Co-Design AI Tools</h3>
    <p>
      Through workshops, surveys, and testing sessions, you'll directly shape how AI serves African classrooms. Not as users—as <strong>builders</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>3. Build a Teacher-Led Network</h3>
    <p>
      Connect with fellow educators across borders. Share strategies. Learn from each other. Amplify our collective voice.
    </p>
    
    <h3>4. Influence Policy and Practice</h3>
    <p>
      When 10,000 teachers speak with one voice, governments, NGOs, and tech companies listen. We become impossible to ignore.
    </p>

    <h2>Why "Founding Teachers"?</h2>
    
    <p>
      The first 10,000 teachers aren't just members—you're <strong>co-founders</strong> of this movement. You'll shape:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      ✓ What tools we build<br>
      ✓ How we govern ourselves<br>
      ✓ Where we focus our energy<br>
      ✓ How we measure success
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You'll get priority access to everything we create, lifetime recognition as a Founding Teacher, and the pride of knowing you helped build Africa's educational future.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Principles</h2>
    
    <p><strong>1. Teachers First</strong><br>
    We are led by teachers, accountable to teachers, and exist to serve teachers.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2. Africa-Centered</strong><br>
    Our solutions honor African languages, cultures, and contexts. No more one-size-fits-all imports.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Open and Transparent</strong><br>
    Every decision, every tool, every strategy—shared openly with our community.</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Action-Oriented</strong><br>
    We don't just talk about change. We build it, test it, and deploy it in real classrooms.</p>

    <h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
    
    <p>
      When you join as a Founding Teacher:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Immediately:</strong> You'll share one real classroom challenge. This insight becomes part of our foundation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Week 1:</strong> Join your country's WhatsApp community. Meet fellow founding teachers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Month 1:</strong> Participate in our first co-design workshop. Your feedback shapes our first tool.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Month 3:</strong> Test early prototypes in your classroom. Give real-world feedback.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Month 6:</strong> See your ideas become real tools helping thousands of teachers across Africa.
    </p>

    <h2>This Is Our Moment</h2>
    
    <p>
      For too long, decisions about African education have been made <em>for us</em>, not <em>by us</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      AI is the biggest transformation in education since the printing press. We can either let others decide how it shapes our classrooms, or we can take the lead.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>TichaAfrica is our chance to lead.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Join us. Not as a follower, but as a founder.
